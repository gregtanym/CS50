                        <h3><u>Background</u></h3>
                        <p>I was born on March 16 1993 in the outskirts of Thailand. I was raised by a Jewish father and an African American mother who spoke chinese.
                        Growing up, we didn't have a lot of money and we could only afford the essentials. However, anime always helped me to get through these tough times. My favourites growing up were "Cory in the House", "Winx Club" and "Hannah Montana".
                        I was never good at school, and considering my racial heritage of being both black and jewish, I was the victim of many bullying cases. I was depressed and stressed all my life. But one day, that all changed.
                        It was the day I met the love of my life, Yang Li. We had so much in common and soon found an interest in each other. We were only 19 at the time but we saw our whole lives ahead of us, and dreamed of running away one day to Iceland.
                        However, that day never came. At the tender age of 21, Yang Li passed away from an aneurysm. Since then I have never been the same. Ghandi once said, "only at your lowest point can you experience the greatest change".
                        That great change came when I finally decided to pick myself up and continue Yang Li's dream of having a child. So I went to orphange and adopted a newborn who had been abandoned by his parents. He was so fresh that he didnt even have a name yet.
                        I decided to make his first name Li Yang to honour my beloved Yang Li, and make his last name a nod to the chinese and jewish culture of my parents by combining them together to get the word Chew.
                        Although he may not be of my blood, Chew Li Yang is my son. We are now living happily in Iceland with Yang Li watching over the both of us.</p>
